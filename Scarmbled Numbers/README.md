This code is a solution of the following problem:

Let a pair of distinct positive integers, (i, j), be considered "scrambled" if you can obtain j by reordering the digits of i.  For example, (12345, 25341) is a scrambled pair, but (12345, 67890) is not.

Given integers A and B with the same number of digits and no leading zeroes, how many distinct scrambled pairs (i, j) are there that satisfy: A <= i < j <= B?

For instance, if we let A = 10 and B = 99, the answer is 36:
(12,21), (13,31), (14,41), (15,51), (16,61), (17,71), (18,81), (19,91), (23,32), (24,42), (25,52), (26,62), (27,72), (28,82), (29,92), (34,43), (35,53), (36,63), (37,73), (38,83), (39,93), (45,54), (46,64), (47,74), (48,84), (49,94), (56,65), (57,75), (58,85), (59,95), (67,76), (68,86), (69,96), (78,87), (79,97), (89,98)

Give the answers for the following A,B
